<p><strong>Supplementary Figure S6. Activity site and conserved residues
from the HD-CE domain.</strong> (A) Alphafold modeling of the HD-CE
domain (CZQ95560.1). The residues conserved in the activity sites are
shown in ball and stick representations. The synapomorphic residues are
colored in yellow. Sequence logo of the conserved regions are shown and
the dotted lines indicate the start and end position of the logo in the
structural model. (B and C ). Activity site of the experimental
crystallized HD domain from the PDB 3G3N without and with the Zn+2 and
MG+2 ions respectively.</p>
