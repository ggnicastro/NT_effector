**Supplementary Figure S6. Activity site and conserved residues from the HD-CE domain.**  (A) Alphafold modeling of the HD-CE domain (CZQ95560.1). The residues conserved in the activity sites are shown in ball and stick representations. The synapomorphic residues are colored in yellow. Sequence logo of the conserved regions are shown and the dotted lines indicate the start and end position of the logo in the structural model. (B and C ). Activity site of the experimental crystallized HD domain from the PDB 3G3N without and with the Zn+2 and MG+2 ions respectively.
