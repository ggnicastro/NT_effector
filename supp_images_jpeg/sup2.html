<p><strong>Supplementary Figure S2. Double PIN structure model.</strong>
(A) Cartoon representation of the double PIN domain. &amp;#946-strands
are depicted in yellow, &amp;#945-helices in dark pink, and the HTH
domain in dark cyan. Catalytic residues are shown in ball-and-stick
representation.(B) Molecular surface representation demonstrating the
occlusion of the active PIN site by the HTH domain. The two PIN domains
are represented in purple, the HTH domain in green, and the position of
the inactive catalytic residues of the inactive PIN domain is depicted
in red.</p>
