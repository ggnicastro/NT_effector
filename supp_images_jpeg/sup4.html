<p><strong>Supplementary Figure S4. Sequence Logo of multiples
Calcineruin families.</strong> Sequences from various calcineurin
homologues were gathered using previously characterized calcineurin PDB
sequences as seeds. These sequences were aligned using the mafft local
pair algorithm, and the logos representing different families were
visualized using the Jalview software. Conserved motifs I-V are depicted
and with boxes.</p>
